**Welcome to the Copper Tube Calculator project** 

In this repository, you'll find the source code required to run the calculator, along with some additional resources. The main file is index.html, which contains the entire page with the copper tube calculator, an informative table, and a PDF manual. The web folder houses the necessary files for the integrated PDF player on the page. Although the numbered HTML pages were not used in this version, they are retained in the project for potential future changes. To simplify the installation, follow these steps:

- To clone this repository to your local machine: 
    git clone https://github.com/agusalta/Copper-developmen-association-Inc.--main

- You can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the copper tube calculator, table, and PDF manual.

**Note:** There is a folder named `calculator` in the cloud where the current project is hosted. It must be replaced with the contents of this repository of the same name for the implementation on the platform.

I hope you find this tool helpful, and the installation process is straightforward! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.


**P.S.`LICENSE.md` IS NECESSARY, THIS PROJECT IMPLEMENTS THE PDF.JS LIBRARY**
